Paul is unconcerned about Torah observant Judaism in this passage.
He writes to a gentile church (1 Cor.
12:2) that was apparently untroubled by such issues.
Instead, his remarks about the Law focus on the uncircumcised.
The Mosaic covenant, Paul argues, brought condemnation and death to them.
Read in this way, Paul 's argument fits the larger context, for it ironically turns the tables on those who have interpreted his suffering negatively.

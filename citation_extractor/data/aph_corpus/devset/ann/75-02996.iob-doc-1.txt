Despite an assumption that Lucan kept the gods out of his epic, it may be argued that he simply kept them out of engagement on the battlefield.
Lucan reproaches the gods (e.g., 4, 243-245 and 4, 807-809) but is not consistent in his reproaches : at times he accuses them of active hostility to Roman liberty (2, 85) ; on other occasions he seems only to blame them for indifference.
Victory in the civil war is the index of divine intent (1, 128), but in declaring the gods ' partisanship for the Caesars the poet never brings the defeat of liberty together with an acknowledgement of Roman guilt : as the epic comes to an end he thus continues angry with gods whose anger against Rome he seems neither to understand nor to forgive.

Lactantius ' elegy on the phoenix, the first Christian poem following classical poetic tradition, shows Lucretius ' influence, especially in the epilogue (Phoen.
161-170), where the phoenix appears as an allegory of the redeemed man.
Here Lactantius converts Lucretius ' equation Venus = pleasure = living nature (1, 1-3) into its opposite : for the phoenix, death = pleasure = Venus.
